C-ODEPACK is a wrapper interface for ODEPACK. 

ODEPACK is a general Differential equation integrator written by Alan C. Hindmarsh and others at LLNL. It can be obtained from netlib or from here:

See ODEPACK documentation for information about citing ODEPACK.

You have to link the binaries to those of ODEPACK. C-ODEPACK as of now only provides a wrapper for DLSODE, not DLSODES or DLSODAR - or any of the Single float
versions of these functions.

Use Makefile.odepack to generate static and dynamic libraries of ODEPACK.

The simple-pendulum example in ./example is fairly easy to follow through.
